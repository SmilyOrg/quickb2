
- use qb2ISound for sound field

- interface for keyboard/mouse input.

- push/pop fill for srGraphics2d? (and make srIGraphics2d)

- merge update and debug draw loop (move JOINS_IN_DEBUG_DRAWING checking to update loop too, and make direct calls to drawDebug for container work).

- merge TopDown, As3Math and surRender into QuickB2 directly

- once qb2ISound is done up, have a parameter for a qb2Tangible to play a sound when it gets hit

- use dirty flags for everything (?)

- make terrain work the same way as qb2Effect as regards ubiquity.

- make sure removeAllEventListeners() works.

- add qb2Flash, qb2_, get/set/is, qb2Internal, qb2I, conventions to manual

- make sure density is preserved in slicing

- fix drawing tracks

- make tires into bodies





- bound circles

- virtual function on qb2Object that is overloaded by subclasses to determine what it contributes as far as geometry for bounding reps (maybe).

- have explode preserve velocities correctly.

- have revolute spring working off of forces

- polish off kill box conditions.

- have a isTouching type function

- have one click build for all .swc and documentation builds...maybe examples too.

- make a qb2MouseEvent to wrap MouseEvent types, and also to have the stage enter/stage leave events

- make laser smoother

- fix .swc so qb2_friend members aren't exposed.


TESTING

- make sure set object only calls mass change thing once

- test adding jello to body and world back and forth

- test moving and adding points for polygon

- make sure joint throws error when you repeatedly add and remove its attached object to/from the world (without destruction listener assigned.

- try to explode a group out of a body (jello out of a body).

- test jello leaving a kill box by positions

- test clone functions for all 3 types

- test that restitution is perserved when explodiong a rounded rect







=== Box2d ISSUES

- weld joint connecting two fixedRotation bodies fails (something to do with box2d, 99%).

- setting identical limits for piston joint seems to make the limit set to zero or something.



=== eventually

- have springs snap to position if they are either (a) within a certain distance to their length and under a certain speed, or (b) moving at a high enough frequency back and forth past their length (meaning very high K/damping)

- figure out a better way for trip sensor to define what object is visiting it, perhaps giving it a bit flag, each bit standing for a level in the world hierarchy...this could also mean getting rid of the otherObject thing for contact event

- matrix transform functions...major thing here is to allow non-uniform scaling and skewing.

- extrusions on amCurve2d's...prolly added to qb2Stock

- have getLinearVel at pnt type functions be available when an object isn't in the world

- component icons

- shatter-type functions

- implement get inertia for all tangibles

- triangle mapping utilities of some kind

- expose AABB query

- expose raycast

- expose other joints (?)

- deal with flushShape case for sensors...when a shape is just being flushed, it shouldn't fire sensor events if it doesn't have to.

- validate/invalidate for various intensive property queries like centerOfMass and bounding reps, so they can be queried multiple times in a single frame without penalty.

- have box2d git thing be pulled in automatically

- fix elbow joints for qb2Stock polyline body...give them limits so they don't tweek out in extreme situations.



FUN

- make a ragdoll class

- make a rope class

- tgheo walker class.

- make a cloth class

- make chain class

- explosion shift
